        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I am Dagmawi Mekonen and I am a Developer, I try to understand
            how things work, and try to improve upon them, whether it is an
            operating system, a program or an object that I use everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
            My studies are mainly about Operating Systems, work flow
            optimizations, low level programming specializing in Rust and
            Fullstack development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to keep things simple with no abstractions like the KISS
            principle that's why most my programs are easy and baren like this
            website for example. I am a heavy supporter of the suckless
            philosophy that I try to incorporate in every aspect of programming.
        </p>
